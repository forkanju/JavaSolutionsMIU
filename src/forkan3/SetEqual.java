/*3. Let us define two arrays as “set equal” if every element in one is also in the other and
vice-versa. For example, any two of the following are equal to one another: {1, 9, 12}, {12, 1, 9},
{9, 1, 12, 1}, {1, 9, 12, 9, 12, 1, 9}. Note that {1, 7, 8} is not set equal to {1, 7, 1} or {1, 7, 6}.
Write a function named isSetEqual(int[ ] a, int[ ] b) that returns 1 if its array arguments are set
equal, otherwise it returns 0.
